Multiform Windows Forms Application 
Design a multiform Windows Forms Application that can be used to test C# skills. The first
form will prompt the user to enter a password and his/her personal information (e.g., a name and
ID). Make up the password “4seneca” and set a limit of up to 3 attempts to access and start the
test. If the user enters in an incorrect password three times and/or personal info is missing, the
program will display an appropriate message and terminate.
If the user enters in the correct password, a new form with a multiple-choice question will be
shown. This form will also contain a button to open a new form with another multiple-choice
question, and so on. You should make up at least five forms with different questions that are
related to C#. The user should answer a question by checking/clicking an appropriate radio
button (e.g., A, B, C etc.). The forms containing questions should also use a timer control to
limit the time to answer each question to 10 seconds. When the time expires the radio buttons
and the Submit button should be disabled. In addition, these forms also contain a label to
display the time left in seconds, as well as a progress bar to graphically display a percentage of
the test that has been completed.
The last form will display the test score/mark and all questions that were answered incorrectly
with correct answers. The user name, id number, and his/her score will also be automatically
saved into a text file, which will be appended.
